# PostgreSQL-installation

##For Windows:
1. Go to http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows
    - Pick the download right under the Beta version.
    - Your download should begin shortly

2. When the download is finished, double click on the downloaded file
    - Click Next>
    - Specify which directory you want PostgreSQL to be installed (or just click next)
    - Make a password for your database (**REMEMBER THIS!!!)
    - Select the port number that the server will listen and click next. (you can always change this http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/41458/changing-postgresql-port-using-command-line)
    - Click next when the default locale comes up (default is United States)
    - When the PostgreSQL setup wizard is complete, uncheck the "Stack Builder" option.
    - Click finish
3. Find the PostgreSQL app and double click it. You can look through all files to find it. I would pin this program to your start menu.
    - When the application appears, double click the "PostgreSQL 9.5 (localhost:[port #])
    - It'll ask for your password (did you remember it?) Only check "Store password" if you are not making a production server.
4. Now we need to make a roles. There are group roles and login roles. For now, we are only going to make Login Roles.
    - Right-click "Login Roles" and select "New Login Role".
    - In the properties tab, make a Role name. The name should be the name of the app
    - In the definition tab, create a simple passwork and type it in again.
    - (If you have a group role, go to the Role membership tab and select the group name. Push the >> button to add the app to the group role.)
    - Click OK.
5. Next we'll create a new database. Do this by selecting the blue arrow in nav bar (the 4th option from the left)
    - Write a database name in the properties tab
    - Select the owner is. If you select a the group role name, every login role that is a member of that group can have access to the database.
    - You can check the SQL code on the SQL tab.
    - Click Ok. This takes a moment.


Congratulations! You now have your first database.
